2015-04-19,"Video Chat with Leandro Amorim, 19, CS student, Universidade Federal Fluminense",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U9nKYF02Cx9RYu...Number 10,"""You may have parent's and kid's account, just like they have in XBox. Parents could inform the kid's schedule, choose the Facebook friends they are allowed to share information. Of course it only make sense for younger kids. But you may apply some level of control over time. If the app knows the kid schedule, it can alert the father if the kid is late.""",Customer Interview,Customer Segments,Teenagers & their parents
2015-04-19,"Video Chat with Deborah Amorim, 13, student, Colégio Pedro 2",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U9nKYF02Cx9RYu...Number 9,"- Deborah would like to be allowed to walk school and home alone. She thinks she might convince her parents easily if she had this app. (Value proposition for teens!)
- Among the app functionalities, she liked the panic button the most. Sometimes she thinks she may feel insecure when she starts to take the bus alone. ""But I don't want to make them nervous. Instead of sending a message like 'I'm feeling in danger', it could send a message 'dad, call me ASAP'. Then, he could call me and make me feel more secure. He could also see where I am and tell me where I could wait for him if I think I need to step out the bus."" (Here she brings 2 insights: having different kinds of alert -- or even being able to personalize the alert -- and, since she still does not know the city very well, she would need someone telling her safe places in the area. Our app could do that for her instead).
- ""My weeks are very alike. Your app could save the route. I take Spanish classes every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday after school. If in one Monday I don't share my localization to my dad, the app could send him an alert: 'Deborah should be going to her Spanish class now. Where is she now?'. I might only have forgotten to share my route, but something could have happened to me"". (an interesting idea for one more feature).
- Other possible use: ""I would also use it to connect with my friends. If we are going to the movies, we could share our locations with each other and it would be easier to find ourselves. I wouldn't have to call them"".",Customer Interview,Customer Segments,Teenagers & their parents
2015-04-19,"Video Chat with Torquato Lima, Business owner, Mesquitão",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U9nKYF02Cx9RYu...Number 8,"He gave an ideia of possible functionality.

They may stop to run some errands in places that would be inside the expected route. He would like to know, so he would not worry in case she takes longer to arrive home.",Customer Interview,Customer Segments,Teenagers & their parents

2) ""What if the kid sends a false alert? I'm not saying that because of Noah, he is a nice kid and old enough to not do this kind of things, but my niece [Lora, number 7] may do that"" >> In our content strategy, we may include interviews with educators or psychologists explaining to parents how to use the moment of downloading and starting use the app as a moment of education about safety and digital privacy.
